                <p class="content">I don’t have time to write out the HSL for 50 shades of grey, but I can tell you a love story of how my partner f***ed me. It all began when I realised I would need an SSL for a custom domain if I wanted effingcode.dev to be mine. So far I have used surge.sh for my publishing needs, but they do not support SSL with a custom domain -- that is if you’re poor like me and can’t pay $30/month. Well, f**k me. Armed with no knowledge at all, I scoured the web for an alternative when my trusted life companion suggested I use Github Pages. Amazing, but what the f**k is git? 
                    <br><br>
                    Donning the mantle of a white knight, my partner shared his wealth of knowledge until he deemed me worthy to wield the mighty sword of git myself. I managed to push my first commit and set up my first Github Page only to realise I immediately needed to push a second commit, then a third, then a fourth, and then finally I was about to do my last commit, correcting the path of an og:image, when my “trusted” life companion says to simply write it as ‘/ogimage.svg’ instead of the whole web address. Of course, my stupid princess ass, trusted him and I pushed a commit that literally did nothing. “But it will work when you have your domain”, he says. BUT I DON’T HAVE A DOMAIN AT THIS VERY MOMENT DO I, FRIEND?! For five f***ing minutes I’ve made stupid correction commits and with this last one I would’ve corrected them all if not for my a**hole boyfriend making me push a f***ing useless commit. If I had done it my way it would’ve been correct, it would’ve made sense but because of him I pushed a commit that says ‘correct og:image path’ and it corrects f***ing nothing! Wow, welcome to Github Emilia, your first public code is absolute shit. 
                    <br><br>
                    At least I’ve learnt to trust in my own ability and ignore whatever the f**k comes out of my partner’s mouth. He might sit on a treasure trove of programming knowledge, but even he needs to shit sometimes -- you know what I mean, between those golden coins you might find something of a different colour. But really, it’s mostly golden. Thank you for teaching me git, I’m never letting you near my code again.

                <p class="content">Funny story. This blog was designed and implemented in one single day. I was tired of studying CSS and to procrastinate I decided to, yep that’s right, write some more CSS. The logic isn’t quite there, but as I slowly descended into madness I figured I wanted a blog to express all this anger and irritation. First, the thought was to just set up some generic wordpress shit, but then, sipping on my cold tea, I had the epiphany that if I’m going to write about code it’s only fair that I code the whole f***ing thing.
                    <br><br>
                    Designing stuff is fun, I enjoy it; the colours and shapes. Unlike code, progress in design is visual and rewarding even when you scrap an idea. The idea is generally still solid, just left to sit in its own shitiness until another project comes along and you pick it clean of the good bits. Code however… if you write it in the “wrong” way or in a “messy” way, you just have to delete rows of code and start anew. 
                    <br><br>
                    This blog. It simply should’ve been a procrastination project, but it gobbled up my whole day. Literally. I began at 2pm and reluctantly left it, in dismay, at 11pm. Sure, I had managed to do the whole thing in just one day, but the pain from writing the same rules over and over, moving around parents and children, realising I need a <code>div</code> for two elements, no wait, it’s better to do it this other way, bickering with myself whether it was worth going about it the long, better way, or just hax it, all of it drained me until I was but a shivering shell of self-hatered. The moments of accomplishment quickly faded as another issue arose, as soon as I was done with this I had to do that. I mean, it’s still not f***ing done. I just gave the f**k up and honestly, to stay sane, I believe this is the case with most websites. Unless you’re a f***ing lunatic programmer who loves to code — props to you, but really you’re insane and maybe.... help?

                <p class="content">Story time. My first scuffle with HTML and CSS was when I as a teenager wanted to move some things around and add a few different colours. I had no interest in learning, I just wanted it to work. So I read through the code and via trial and error — viola, somehow, success. Now, as the older designer me realise I need to learn this shit, I mix things up because I think I know something but it turns out the way I thought it worked was way, way, way off. Like how boxes work and how to best move them around the page. To top it all off there is this thing called flexbox I apparently should learn, and also, this thing called grid. One person will say the box model is superior, the other that flexbox takes them all, and the third that you ain’t a master until you’ve mastered the grid.
                    <br><br>
                    Well, f**k you all. F**k boxes, f**k flexbox, and f**k grid. I’ve made a cute f***ing design and I need it working asap! What do you mean flexbox is good for responsive design? Why should I care about writing 2-dimensional code with grid layout? How is learning the box model fundamentally important to understanding CSS?
                    <br><br>
                    I mean, margin and padding is relatively easy to understand, but when I’m knee high in <code>justify-content justify-items align-content align-items align-self grid-whatever-thef**k</code> — I’m out.
