            <p class="content">Funny story. This blog was designed and implemented in one single day. I was tired of studying CSS and to procrastinate I decided to, yep that’s right, write some more CSS. The logic isn’t quite there, but as I slowly descended into madness I figured I wanted a blog to express all this anger and irritation. First, the thought was to just set up some generic wordpress shit, but then, sipping on my cold tea, I had the epiphany that if I’m going to write about code it’s only fair that I code the whole f***ing thing.
                <br><br>
                Designing stuff is fun, I enjoy it; the colours and shapes. Unlike code, progress in design is visual and rewarding even when you scrap an idea. The idea is generally still solid, just left to sit in its own shitiness until another project comes along and you pick it clean of the good bits. Code however… if you write it in the “wrong” way or in a “messy” way, you just have to delete rows of code and start anew. 
                <br><br>
                This blog. It simply should’ve been a procrastination project, but it gobbled up my whole day. Literally. I began at 2pm and reluctantly left it, in dismay, at 11pm. Sure, I had managed to do the whole thing in just one day, but the pain from writing the same rules over and over, moving around parents and children, realising I need a <code>div</code> for two elements, no wait, it’s better to do it this other way, bickering with myself whether it was worth going about it the long, better way, or just hax it, all of it drained me until I was but a shivering shell of self-hatered. The moments of accomplishment quickly faded as another issue arose, as soon as I was done with this I had to do that. I mean, it’s still not f***ing done. I just gave the f**k up and honestly, to stay sane, I believe this is the case with most websites. Unless you’re a f***ing lunatic programmer who loves to code — props to you, but really you’re insane and maybe.... help?

            <p class="content">Story time. My first scuffle with HTML and CSS was when I as a teenager wanted to move some things around and add a few different colours. I had no interest in learning, I just wanted it to work. So I read through the code and via trial and error — viola, somehow, success. Now, as the older designer me realise I need to learn this shit, I mix things up because I think I know something but it turns out the way I thought it worked was way, way, way off. Like how boxes work and how to best move them around the page. To top it all off there is this thing called flexbox I apparently should learn, and also, this thing called grid. One person will say the box model is superior, the other that flexbox takes them all, and the third that you ain’t a master until you’ve mastered the grid.
                <br><br>
                Well, f**k you all. F**k boxes, f**k flexbox, and f**k grid. I’ve made a cute f***ing design and I need it working asap! What do you mean flexbox is good for responsive design? Why should I care about writing 2-dimensional code with grid layout? How is learning the box model fundamentally important to understanding CSS?
                <br><br>
                I mean, margin and padding is relatively easy to understand, but when I’m knee high in <code>justify-content justify-items align-content align-items align-self grid-whatever-thef**k</code> — I’m out.
